* What happened *: It turned out to implement a program that can encrypt/decrypt, the text is written in English or Ukrainian by the key, and has a key selection method that creates all decryption options
* What could NOT be done from the basic requirements *: It was not possible to make it possible to call Bruteforce without adding a key, and the class itself was not very successful

* Features of the project *: The entire encryption and decryption system is built on a char array, the file is read and transferred to a character array, then passes it to the main encryption/decryption algorithm and at the end creates a new file in which it writes the processed array. It also uses encapsulation behind in order to preserve the integrity of the data, and handled most possible errors, by the try-catch block.
